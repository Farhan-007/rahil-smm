### How to use these:

- Put these files inside your `posts` or `content/blog` folder (depending on your setup).
- Your code should read and parse these `.md` files, extract frontmatter (metadata), and render the markdown content.
- If you want, I can help you with a script or Next.js code snippet to load and parse these files.

Want me to do that next?
